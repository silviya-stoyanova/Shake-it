# *Shake it*

You are looking at ***the final project*** of the course ReactJS at SoftUni.

  

This is a SPA (single page application) that relies on MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS (MERN).

___

  
  
  

# Let's get started!

  

### 1. Install packages

In the project root open a new terminal and type

  

```bash

npm install

```

  

or

  

```bash

yarn install

```

  

### 2. Start application

In order to start the application, you need to accomplish several steps:

  

1. First of all you need to start MongoDB by running mongod.exe. For example, from the Command Prompt:

```bash

"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod.exe"

```

  

This starts the main MongoDB database process. The *waiting for connections* message in the console output indicates that the mongod.exe process is running successfully.

  

2. Then you are ready to run the server

  

Open a new Command Prompt, navigate to the "server" folder and type:

  

```bash

nodemon app

```

  

3. Now you are ready to do the final step. In a new Command Prompt navigate to the "client" folder and type

  

```bash

npm start

```

  
  

If everything goes well, a browser window should be opened automatically at http://localhost:3000.

This is the default port on which react applications created by create-react-app run.

(The server run at port 5000.)

  

And you are ready to..
