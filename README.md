# *&copy; Shake it*
 
You are looking at ***the final project*** of the course ReactJS at SoftUni.

This is a single page web application (SPA) that relies on MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS (MERN). It is divided mainly in two parts:
+  public (for all guests)
+  private (for users / **admin**)

It uses the following programming concepts, specific to the React library: client-side routing, stateless and statefull components, bound forms, synthetic events, lifecycle methods, React Hooks, Context API, and so on.

This application is about a company that offers some of the best milkshakes you have ever tried. *Enjoy it!*

# Let's get started!
 

### 1. Install packages

When the project is cloned or downloaded, type in the terminal the following in both Server and Client directory:
  
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```
  

### 2. Start application

In order to start the application, you need to accomplish several steps:
  
1. First of all you need to start MongoDB by running mongod.exe. For example, from the Command Prompt:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod.exe"
```

This starts the main MongoDB database process. The *waiting for connections* message in the console output indicates that the mongod.exe process is running successfully.

2. Then you are ready to run the server

Open a new Command Prompt, navigate to the "server" folder and type:
```bash
nodemon app
```

3. Now you are ready to do the final step. In a new Command Prompt navigate to folder "client" and type
```bash
npm start
```
If everything goes well, a browser window should be opened automatically at http://localhost:3000. This is the default port on which react applications created by create-react-app run, while the server runs at port 5000.
  

# It's time to play around ã‹¡
  
### The database is running on port 27017 and has a newly created collection called "shake-it-db" with a seeded admin profile.
 
	 Admin credentials:

	- username: admin
	- fancy password: admin123

Now you can add some products and see my project at it's best ã‹› ðŸ˜Š ã‹¡

# Code explanation

## Client side
  

### The client side of the application relies on the library ReactJS (*a powerful component-based JavaScript library that uses server-side rendering (SSR)*) and also on several other libraries:

1.  **react-dom** - used to access and modify the DOM
2.  **react-router-dom** - provides client-side routing, used to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates
3.  **react-scripts** - a package that includes scripts and configuration used by create-react-app
4.  **react-toastify** - used to notify the user about their actions
  

### Client folder consist of two main folders:
  
+  **public**
	+ includes index.html file with main element with id "root" which is used to render in it react components.
+  **src**
	+ includes all used react components
	+ some helpful utilities
	+ written tests
	+ static files (such as scc and images)
	+ App.js combines these react components
	+ index.js is the main file. It is used to render components in the html element with id "root" (at ../public/index.js)


## Server side
  
### The server side of the application relies on the framework ExpressJS (*a NodeJS based framework, used to rapidly develop Web apps*) and also on several other libraries:

1.  **body-parser** - used to handle POST requests
2.  **express-session** - to successfully maintain a session on the server
3.  **jsonwebtoken** - for user authorization
4.  **mongoose** - provides schema validation and a way to model data, stored in MongoDB
5.  **multiparty** - parse incoming form data including files
6.  **mv** - this library allows you to move a file from one partition of the hard drive to another
7.  **passport** - for user authentication
8.  **passport-local** - this module goes along with passport, it lets you authenticate using a username and password in Node.js applications.
  

### Let's take a quick look at the server folder. It consist of many folders:

+ **config** - here is all of the configuration that NodeJS libraries need

	+ in auth.js are defined two methods, used as middlewares when performing routing. They rely on the usage of the module "jsonwebtoken"

	+ database.js is used to fulfill the connection to the database (MongoDB)

	+ express.js consist of middlewares which take part in parsing incoming forms' data (POST requests), maintaining session on the server, performing authentication with passport and defining a set of headers that allow the browser and server to communicate.

	+ in passport.js is the configuration of the module with the same name

	+ and last but not least - routes.js - it is used to handle different types of incoming requests, most of them have an authentication middleware

+ **controllers** - include methods used to perform the desired operation

+ **models** - here are defined all mongoose schemas *(they define the structure of the document, default values, validators, etc.)* and models based on them *(they provide an interface to the database for creating, querying, updating, deleting records, etc.)*

+ **upload** - this folder is used to store the uploaded images

+ **utilities** - here is the encryption file that helps storing hashed version of a user's password

+ in **app.js** everything is combined together and the server is started upon the following command: node/nodemon app

## About the tests..

### In this application are used Jest and Enzyme

**1. Jest** - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used as a unit testing framework. It acts as a  test runner, assertion library, provides a good mocking support *(which means it could execute different unit test cases)*  and also Snapshot testing. In short - it executes the test.

**2. Enzyme** - [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is a testing library that creates a simpler interface for writing unit tests and make it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output. It adds additional methods for rendering a  component  finding elements, and  interacting with elements.

If you are willing to run the tests to see if everything goes well, in a new terminal type the following command:
```bash
npm run test
```
When you run this command, Jest will launch in *watch mode*. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like how  `npm start`  recompiles the code. The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs.
