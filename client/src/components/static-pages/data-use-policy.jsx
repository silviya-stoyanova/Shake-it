            <p>We may use information that we collect through our Services for a variety of purposes supporting our mission, including to:</p>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Service Providers. We may share your information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as <a href="http://www.benetech.org/want-to-help/contact-us/privacy-policy/#Cookies">Google Analytics</a>, MailChimp, and Vertical Response.</li>
                <li>Other Parties When Required By Law or as Necessary to Protect the Services. We may disclose your information to third parties in order to:</li>
                <li>Protect the legal rights, safety, and security of The Lab and the users of our Services;</li>
                <li>Enforce the terms of use of our Services;</li>
                <li>Prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes);</li>
                <li>Comply with or respond to law enforcement or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government or other entity, whether or not legally required. If The Lab intends to disclose a member’s information to law enforcement or in response to a legal process, we will make reasonable efforts to promptly notify the member—and, if the member is under 18, the member’s parent or legal guardian—unless directed not to by a court of law. In Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.</li>
                <li>De-identified and Aggregate Information. We may share de-identified or aggregate data with any entity, including for research and analysis purposes. De-identified data is data that is not linked or reasonably linkable to a particular person or device. Aggregate data is data we collect that has been combined with information from others so that the recipient of the data is not able to identify any particular person or device from the data. However, we will never share personally identifiable information with third party commercial entities for direct marketing purposes, unless you give us permission.</li>
                <li>Other Parties With Your Consent. We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Data Security</strong></h3>
            <p>Protection of our users’ information is important to us, so we maintain security safeguards to help protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information you provide to us. However, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.</p>
            <h3><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h3>
            <p>The privacy and protection of children is of great importance to us. We will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 18 without obtaining consent from a parent or legal guardian, except as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
            <h2><strong>Social Networking and Third Party Sites</strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Social Networking Services</strong></h3>
            <p>We have worked with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services, including but not limited to Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter, to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. The third-party social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. The third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies.</p>
            <p>If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.</p>
            <h3><strong>Links to Third Party Sites and Services</strong></h3>
            <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Policy does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.</p>
            <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
            <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
            <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
            <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
            <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
            <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
            <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
            <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
            <h3>Where we send your data</h3>
            <p>We do not sell data about visitors under any circumstances. Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.&nbsp;When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
            <p>Contact information and communications preferences submitted through contact forms or signup forms on this site may be shared with the third-party vendors we use to manage newsletters, event registrations, and other communications activities.</p>
            <p><strong>If you would like to unsubscribe from our email communications at any time, you may do so in the footer of any of our emails. If you would like us to delete your information entirely, please&nbsp;contact us at hello@digitalimpact.org.</strong></p>
            <h2><strong>Updates and Communications</strong></h2>
